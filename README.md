"# graphs_jumps" 
This app is an example of a graph data structure implementation, and the more important functions are find_all_paths and find_min_path, wich allows us ,respectively, to find all available paths between two nodes or vertices of the graph (source and destination cities in this case), and to find the shortest path.

If there's not any path from one city to another, the function find_all_path will return an empty list ( [] ), and the find_min_path will return a 0 as number of minimum jumps and a empty list as the minimum path.
